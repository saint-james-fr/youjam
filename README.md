This is our amazing YouJam app for Le Wagon final project during Le Wagon Web Dev course (2022).
Basic concept is a social network for muscians allowing them to meet and book jam sessions.

Developped by Anne Ly, Pierre Petel, Gaspard Fauchille, Benjamin Doberset & myself (Maxence Robinet) on Ruby On Rails.
